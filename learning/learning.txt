React Query tutorial 1

React Query?
a library for fetching data in react application

why?
since react is a ui library , there is no specific pattern for data fetching
useEffect hook for data fetching and useState hook to maintain component state like loading, error or resulting data
if data is needed throughout the app , we tend to use state management library
most of state management libraries are good for working with client state 
e.g theme for aplication/whether a modal is open
state management libraries are not grat for working with asynchronous or server state 


Client vs server state
Client state
persistent inyour app memory and accessing or updating it is synchronous

Server state
persisted remotely and require asynchronous Apis for fetching or updating

has shared ownership 
data can be updated by someone else without your knowledge
ui data may not be in sync with remote data
challenging when you have to deal with caching, dedupnig multiple request for the same data, updating stale data in the background, performance optimization etc

it require time do it all or use library can handle all these we can use this
